						<p dir="ltr">
							Each student needs to have a clear idea of their future plans (i.e higher studies /
							campus placement / any other option) and accordingly participate in the placement
							process. If a student is strongly interested in higher studies then it is better not to
							participate in the placement process. Taking a job and going for higher education will
							affect badly for (a) company, (b) other students including junior batches and (c) IITH
							reputation
						</p>
					</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">
							The students graduating in the academic year 2022-23 and seeking employment in the

							Registration through the student portal(OCS) is mandatory.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">
							During the placement process the student has to (i) log in the student portal (this is
							one time process) and (ii) register individually with each company for which he/she is
							eligible and interested. Both these registrations have to be done on OCS portal within
							the respective deadlines.

				<ol>
					<li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">
							A master CV is a resume that states absolutely everything that you have done in your

							for a different position.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">
							The resume with which one applies for a particular company must be a subset of the

							The OCS Portal creates your resume automatically in the standard IITH format based on
							the information provided during registration.

							Students must prepare resumes in various formats as per the job profile of individual

					<li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">
							The student must safely maintain originals of all certificates (as applicable) including
							birth, SSC, education, caste, income, medical, domicile, passport, PAN, and other
							certificates etc. These originals should be made available for verification at any time
							during the process. It is advised to also maintain the above documents as xerox copies

						<p dir="ltr">
							Students who have applied for a job opening at a company must attend a Pre-Placement

						<p dir="ltr">
							After attending the PPT the student may decide to de-register for the company soon after
							the completion of PPT with a valid reason.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">
							It is the sole responsibility of students to check the details / profile of the company
							before registering or after attending PPT. Students are free to approach the placement
							office for any queries.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr">
							Sometimes, the company may conduct online tests before PPT. In such cases, students
