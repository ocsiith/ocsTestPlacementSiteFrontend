			"rounds": "Three rounds one online test (aptitude + coding + problem solving) and two interview rounds were held for the selection process.",
			"preparation": "First round was about coding and they checked the understanding of algorithms and dynamic programming. Questions on probability, linear algebra and other mathematical concepts were asked so make sure to have a good hold on these concepts. Interview round was about brainstorming on problems and puzzles. These were mostly probability based and the interviewers were dropping hints if stuck. Prepare well on the projects mentioned in the resume and data structures and algorithms.",
			"tips": "I was way too nervous for interviews but from my past experience I just confidently gave my interview not worrying too much about the results and that is what the interviewers liked, they were quite friendly and helped me get my thought process on right track. It will be a great experience and make sure you are conveying your thought process to them as that is what they expect from you rather than getting to the correct solution.",
			"experience": "I started my preparation in the summers prior to internship season but I practiced coding before at a slower pace. I would suggest to start earlier and practice solving a lot of problems within a time limit.  Practicing competitive programming or even solving problems on own pace on websites like GFG or LeetCode will help in clearing the rounds. Can brush up the mathematical concepts (from course work) in the last month which would be more like a revision of those.",

			"rounds": "There were 2 rounds. First round was a online test and 2nd round was technical interview. \n\nThe online test consisted of 6 sections and was conducted for 2hrs. \nThe first section had 2 programming/coding questions, both were very easy compared to questions of any other companies online test. \nIn 2nd section we had to write an essay of about 200 words about our experience of working in team/while doing a project. In this section they mainly want to know what problems we faced while working in a team/working on a project and how we overcame those problems. \nRest of the sections were MCQs with 5 questions each from ML, Linear algebra, aptitude and theory questions related to computer science.\nThis test was common for Product intern and MDSR intern role, so sections like ML, essays were meant for MDSR intern role.\n\nThe technical round lasted 1hr and for me it was mostly about my projects and theoretical concepts related to Machine learning and deep learning, I got lucky here because the interviewer I got was already working in ML domain, so he was happy to ask questions about the concepts I know well. For others who the attended the interview the questions was mainly based on CP(coding questions) and core CS concepts like OS and DBMS.",
			"preparation": "For the Online test, its easy to crack the coding questions. The MCQs are pretty hard so try to be strong in fundamental concepts. Its better to think of problems you faced and solutions you came up with while doing a project/working in team before the test. If you go through previous year Adobe papers its very clear that they ask students to write an essay. So be ready with the essay before the exam( mainly if you want to apply for research/MDSR intern). \n\nComing to Technical Interview, again be strong with fundamentals and know the projects you wrote in resume very well. As they'll ask questions surrounding concepts of the projects you did. Try to make a good impression with interviewer as that time they won't bother if you mess up few questions. Add some hobbies and extracurricular activities in your resumes as it'll help break the ice.",
			"tips": "Not much tips for online test except have strong fundamentals. \nComing to Technical Interview fundamentals are important but things like the way you introduce yourself are also important. So take proper time making a proper resume and take time learning how to speak in interviews and give a proper intro.",
			"experience": "After the end of 4th semester that is starting of May, I started revising ML and DL concepts as I couldn't understand them properly while the semester was going on. Until the end of July i was reading core concepts, near the mid of July we found out about companies coming to college and we had to start making resumes. From then I started learning how to make resumes and practicing little CP, I already did little CP in my 2nd semester when we got break for covid. If you know a programming language fully and didn't do CP before then its better to start practicing from start of June. We had interviews in first weekend of September. I spent the last 2-3 days learning how to talk in interviews and how to give a proper introduction. So I would suggest to have 2 days free before Interview for preparing for speaking in the interview. ",

There were 2 panel members and interview was about 25-30 min. It started with me introducing myself to them, and then followed by the projects I had done. Later the interviewer gave me a simple coding question to start off and slowly kept adding few variations to the same question. After getting stuck at one point of time, i explained her my thought process and she helped me in leading to the solution by giving few hints. After i was ready with the solution, interviewers were happy with the code and the way i worked it out to the final solution. This interview didnt include any quesions on OOPS or OS.",
			"preparation": "Being thorough in all the concepts of DSA (including theoretical knowledge) will keep in you a better position throughout the internship selection process. Basic idea of OS and OOPS conceps will help even more. Keeping in mind the time constraint in coding round is important. It's relatively easier in interview round as you can get selected even if you are not able to write the code completely , as long as you are able to explain your thoughts and idea of solving the problem given you have a friendly interviwer :)",
			"tips": "For written (coding) round only suggestion would be to practise as many coding questions as possible from leetcode,gfg,codechef,etc and to have fair knowledge in DSA, and a little of OOPS and OS (although i had no knowledge of these that time). At the start make sure you are able to completely solve the question without any hints, and then slowly start practising keeping a certain time limit which plays a key role for scoring relatively good in coding rounds. Most of the questions asked in the coding round would be of similar models and hence the more the number of questions you practise, more the chance of you doing well. \n\nFor the interview round based on my personal experince, the ultimate suggestion would be not to panic. I read the same lines from ocs internship experiences but didnt understand the importance back then, but i realised its importance when i did poor in one of the interviews for a different company where i was asked a question which i knew and was easy, but then i just paniced so much that i couldn't answer that. We generally tend to panic because we think way too ahead than the current situation. Later that day, i had interview for amazon where i was asked a question which was completely new for me, but then i was just thinking about the problem rather than thinking of what will happen if i dont get a solution. Eventually i was able to solve the problem with the hints given by my interviwer. Also make sure you keep telling about your thought process to the interviwer and only then he/she will be able to give you hints in that direction. Sometimes its fine if you cant completely code as long as you find a way to solve the question.",
			"experience": "I started my preparation relatively late, at around middle of my summer holidays after 4th Semester. I relied completely on gfg's DSA course for learning and later practised various coding problems on leetcode, hackerrank, codechef, etc. Its better to start learning from end of 4th sem (or early if possible), so that you will have ample time to practise questions during summer break. One major challenge i faced was that i knew the concepts but was not able to code within the given time, i did overcome this in due course of time by practising alot of questions online with time limit, and also by writing different mock tests.",

HackerRank platform was used for the test; There are a few public test cases and a lot more private ones.\n\nThen on Day 1 of the Internship Drive, there were 3 Technical Interviews followed by a HR Round. The Technical Interviews tested DSA topics like Graphs, Trees, DP. The final Technical Interview revolved around the projects I had mentioned on my Resume - Fullstack Website & CA Portal for Elan 2021 and COVID Simulation program in C. We discussed about the projects, Technologies I Used for them, Improvements possible and other aspects.\n\nIn the HR Round, following questions were asked: How did you feel about the entire process? Tell me about yourself and your family. What do you know about Arcesium? \nThis round is just a formality in most cases. If you've made it to this round, you'll most likely get the offer.",
			"preparation": "CP should be the topmost priority during the preparation. Try to solve as many Coding Questions as you can. You could start by reading up articles about a particular topic on Topcoder, then practicing Questions related to the topic on Codeforces, SPOJ, or other platforms. Apart from this, You should brush up CS Fundamentals - OS, OOPS, etc.",
			"tips": "In the Online Test round, try to get partial points for a question if you're unable to solve it completely. Since it's essentially a filtering round for the interviews, even being ahead by others by a small margin also matters.\n\nFor the Interview Round, I'd recommend speaking your though process while solving the question. This helps the interviewer understand your approach and he/she/they can provide hints based on your approach or tell you it's wrong. During my 2nd Interview, I was initially going in the wrong direction, but since I was speaking what was going on in my mind, a hint or two from the interviewer were enough to correct the approach. One thing that will help you the most is being relaxed during the time of the interview. One thing that will help you the most is Understanding that the Interviewer is not some evil person ( 99.9% of the cases :D). So don't be afraid of him or hesitate to talk to him if you're stuck for a long time.\n\nAlso as a general advice, try to keep your Resume 1 page long, not more not less. Try to have at least one project in your resume, so the interviewer may have something to talk about apart from asking questions related to DSA. A discussion about a project can give the interviewer insights about your dev skills, technolgies you've used before along with other aspects that cannot be tested by just asking questions.",
			"experience": "I started my preparation after the end of 4th Sem. I had 2 Data Structures Courses in my curriculum along with an Algorithm Course. So I was quite familiar with DSA concepts beforehand. For Coding, I relied on SPOJ initially to solve a few basic questions of each topic. Then once I was familiar with almost all topics, I went for the Codeforces contests which give you a Time Bound Test experience. I used to refer to Topcoder or Codeforces blogs for topics that were new to me.",

The three DSA questions were rather simple, and included questions about substrings and possible paths in a 2D matrix. \n\nThere were two interview rounds, one right after the other. In the first one, I was asked to describe the projects in my CV in detail and they even asked me a few in-depth questions about the work I did in my previous internship. They also asked me how I ended up working on the projects mentioned in my CV and why I was interested in them. After that, we moved on to the coding part of the interview. I was given a graph question based on Dijkstra's algorithm. I spent around 30-40 minutes working through this and the interviewers pushed my thinking towards the right direction by asking intuitive questions. In the end, my solution didn't execute completely due to an indexing error in the test cases but since my logic was correct they let it pass and moved on. This was followed by a few short questions about OOP concepts and some questions about Networks. However, once I told them the Networks course hadn't been covered in my curriculum yet they dropped it and told me to continue to the next interview.\n\nThe next interview was a short HR/critical thinking one. I was asked a few questions about my future goals and motivations, and given a logic puzzle. Here's the puzzle if anyone's interested: you are given three baskets labelled Apples, Oranges and Apples + Oranges. However, each basket is mislabelled. You are allowed to pick only one fruit from just one basket. Which basket will you pick and how will you correct the labels based on this pick?",

			"tips": "For the written round, work smart before you work hard. One question though solvable was pretty lengthy. I realised I could use the test cases to my benefit to come up write a quicker solution so I worked backwards and scored full.\n\nFor the interview round, thinking out loud and is absolutely crucial. When I was given the graph question, I didn't keep a single thought to myself. This greatly helped both me and the interviewers because they could gauge my problem solving skills and nudge me towards the right solution at the same time. While coding, any time I got an error I tried to stay calm and printed variables to locate the error. They commented on my debugging skills due to this rather than judging the errors. Being honest and admitting when you're stuck also helps. At one point, I even told the interviewers that I knew the solution called for Dijkstra's algorithm but I didn't remember the algorithm itself. They told me to forget that such an algorithm exists and asked me to create my own solution. They were very friendly and kept cross-questioning me throughout and constantly tried to put me at ease. The entire interview felt like a semi-formal chat with a senior or a colleague.",
			"experience": "I had two data structure courses and an algorithms course as a part of my curriculum. I brushed up on these concepts and watched a few YouTube lectures from channels like Abdul Bari for revising. For coding practice, I did a few questions from the GFG archives for a few weeks before the exams. I'd suggest having a group of friends to discuss questions with. I did so with two of my friends and this helped me way more than any individual prep I did because it exposed me to many more questions and methods. Preparing with friends also helped my anxiety greatly because it reminded me that everyone was in the same boat and I wasn't alone.\n\nI also had next to no experience with CP (and honestly I still don't) before I started preparing but was still able to perform reasonably well in the tests and interviews so try not to get discouraged or overwhelmed when you start your prep.

Additionally every candidates must attempt at least one of the three sections ( Analog, Digital and Communications). Each section has 20 questions which have to be solved in 45 minutes. In analog section questions based on Circuit & Network Analysis, Opamps, Transistors etc. were asked.\n\nAfter we qualify the technical test, we will be promoted to technical interview. I applied only for analog position. So all the questions asked were specific to analog domain. The interview went on for about 40 - 45 minutes. Initially basic questions related to Circuit analysis were asked. As the interview progressed more ",
			"preparation": "Revision of Circuit theory, Analog electronics will help a lot. Refer to videos by YouTube channels like All about Electronics etc. will also help.",

			"preparation": "1.RESUME: Basically I am interested in core so i just put some important core projects which i have done in my core courses and revised them thoroughly.\nSo,I would suggest the same to my juniors. \n2.TECHNICAL TEST & APTITUDE:  In JD company provided some topics according to the domains. So i just revised those topics from basics and solved some problems and also gone through some previous competitive papers like gate etc.\nFor aptitude i just practised some mock tests in online.\n3.TECHNICAL INTERVIEW: Panel members started interview from resume itself. They asked me questions about projects that i had mentioned in the resume. I explained everything about project. Then, they started asking basics  questions from the topics mentioned( signals and systems, analog communication techniques, Digital communications, sampling and quantization and Dsp) After the basic questions they increased the level of difficulty and given some problems. They asked me about theoretical back ground in the question and observed how my approach was. When i was getting something then they provided me with some hints and supported me to think. ",
			"tips": "1. For written test I would suggest to go through topics clearly and then solve some mock tests before the test.\n2. For interview first thing being calm and steady is important. And ask them if you need any help. If you are not getting anything don't give up atleast give your approach even that counts too. Be clear with basics.",
			"experience": "Frankly i didn't have any preparation and didn't followed any strategy. Just before one week i started going through the topics. For that i have used class materials of related courses and also followed MIT opencourseware. Some mobile apps for covering basics. And for aptitude and practise i have written some mock tests  of gate and isro. From starting onwards i have been clear with my resume. That's it.  Thank you.",
