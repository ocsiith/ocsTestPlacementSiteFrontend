Just keep solving problems on a daily basis and try to make sure your problem solving skills are sharp before the interview stage. \n\nAlso, practice writing code on paper and explaining your thought process to the interviewer in the month of November. Even if you're unable to solve the problem in the first go, try to explain your current thought process and slowly try to build a working logic using some cues (direct/ indirect) from the interviewer. Avoid long duration of silence in the interview. Communicating your thought process is as important as your problem solving skill. \n\nDon't compare yourself with anyone, stay cool and focus on your own process throughout the placement season.

First I was asked why I used a specific technology in one of my projects. Then one of the panelists asked a basic math question to which I gave my explanation. After that, they gave me a situation and asked me to point out what needs to be solved to make the system reliable. After some discussion, I arrived at what they were expecting from me. Later, the other panelist was looking at my resume and started asking questions on DBMS(because I mentioned my DBMS project on my resume). He asked me some basic questions like what is RDBMS, Normalisation, types of Normalisation.This was followed by some basic data structure questions. Then they started asking questions on OOPs(which I mentioned on my resume). Starting with the definition of virtual function, they went on giving me situations and asked how I would use OOP in those situations. They seemed satisfied with my answers.\n\nInterview 2(45 minutes to 1 hr): This round was mostly based on puzzles and system design. First the panelists asked me to pick one project from my resume and explain it to them. Then they shared a google doc and started pasting questions. The first question was related to probability and a follow up question on the same. Then they asked me two puzzle like questions. That was followed by a system design question with multiple modifications within the question(stuff like what data structures to use, design decisions, how to make the system fault tolerant, etc). \n\nInterview 3(15 minutes): This interview is not technical.

The second section consisted of Probability and Counting questions \u2013 medium-hard (14). The third section consisted of Data structure and Algorithm MCQs \u2013 Easy (11). The second paper consisted of 2 Coding questions (Easy-medium).  \nThey shortlisted around 30 students for the interviews.\nRound 2(Interview 1 \u2013 1hr 10mins): This round mostly tested my C++ and Math skills.  \n\nThe interviewer asked me in which language do I code and I answered C++. \nHe asked about OOP in C++. \nHe started with basics and moved on to the more complex ones. \nHe asked about Encapsulation, Abstraction, asked me to explain Polymorphism with a real-world example and how internally run time polymorphism works (vtables and vpointers). \nHe then asked about the Multiple Inheritance and Diamond Problem.  \nHe asked about why do we need a Copy constructor and can It be private. \nHe then moved on to the differences between shallow copy and deep copy and what does the copy constructor does. He then asked me whether I know any design patterns and I answered yes and I named singleton and factory. \nHe asked deeply about singleton when and where do we use it and an example of it where it is used. \nHe then asked me a probability question: Find the expected value of the number of coin tosses to get 2 consecutive heads i.e, \u201cHH\u201d. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expected-number-of-coin-flips-to-get-two-heads-in-a-row/). I wrote the recurrence relation and he was satisfied. \n\nHe then moved on to the Coding question, he asked me to code to detect whether there is a cycle in a) directed graph and b) undirected graph. He asked me if I have any questions. I asked about the work-life at JPMC and how the current team is going to be. (Be prepared with some nice questions beforehand) . I answered all the questions and I got the call for the next round.\n\nRound 3(Interview 2 \u2013 45 mins): This round is mostly tested my Coding and Probability skills. He started with probability puzzles.\n\nIf I flip a fair coin 10 times, what\u2019s the expected number of \u201cHH\u201d observed.  For this, I was trying to write a recurrence as well, but I couldn\u2019t exactly get it. He then gave a clue of defining a random variable X_i if both the ith and (i+1)th toss are heads and then apply the Linearity of expectation to it. I picked up on the clue and solved it. Later I found the same question being on stackexchange (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1940118/expected-number-of-hh-in-10-coin-flips).\n\nWhat is the probability that n points lie on the same side of the semi-circle. This is a very standard question which I saw before and hence answered it. \nHe then moved on to coding questions which were pretty standard ones,\n\n1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/ \n2. Detect Cycle in a graph \nI answered all the above questions and then the interviewer asked if I had any questions. I asked him regarding the work at JPMC and how different JPMC is doing compared to GS and other investment banks. It\u2019s always good if you make the interviewer that you are keen on working with the company and wanted to know more about it.\n\nRound 4(HR Round \u2013 15mins): This is a general HR round where she asked why I was interested in working at JPMC. \nWhere do I live? \nAm I willing to relocate etc.\nAll the rounds went well and JPMC hired 3 students from our college.",
			"preparation": "Nothing can get you up to interview rounds for any software companies except competitive programming.For a SDE role or even Data Scientist (preliminary rounds), mostly all of them would be tested on your problem-solving and logical skills. It\u2019s good to do other things too but doing CP regularly helps a lot. For the interview rounds, be confident and communicate effectively with the interviewer regarding your thought process. Don\u2019t lie in the interview as the interview may go in a very different way. If you are not comfortable with any concepts tell straight away that you are not aware of it. Interviews will be focussed on OOP, OS,Networks and System Design. For System design see Gaurav sen's videos and educative.io grokking the system design interview course. I was giving Atcoder and Codeforces contests which helped me a lot in terms of my speed. Give contests regularly and upsolve them. I used to do some standard questions from interviewbit which I would say that more aligned towards some specific standard algorithms. I recommend giving short contests from the very beginning so that you will be habituated for the time constraints. Again nothing can take you far except CP. Do practice Aptitude and Probability. I was not shortlisted in some of them because of attempting them badly. For investment banking companies like JPMC and GS,  quant is rigorously tested so don't take it for granted.\n",
			"tips": "Do practice Quant, Probability, and puzzles as they play a very important role in interviews in many companies. There are many resources out there, I followed \n1. Heard on Street\n2. Practical Guide to Quant Finance(https://usermanual.wiki/Document/Practical20Guide20To20Quantitative20Finance20Interview.604244935.pdf)\n\nDon\u2019t lose your hope if not selected in your dream companies. I lost my whole confidence when I didn\u2019t get selected for Google and Razorpay even though I answered all the questions in the online rounds. The thing with interviews is they are hugely dependent on LUCK. It highly depends on the interviewer and questions too. So being panic, and talking about other easy interviews with your friends, just makes you feel more demotivated. Don't at all take aptitude for granted. In my case I got an offline interview offer from Trilogy Innovations (Codenation) , I passed all the 5 interview rounds and online test but I didn't got the required score for the last proctored CCAT (https://www.criteriacorp.com/assessments/cognitive-aptitude/criteria-cognitive-aptitude-test-ccat) test due to which the offer was halted. It felt so bad as after even passing Online Test and 5 interviews just because of the CCAT test the offer is been halted.\n\nOn the day of the interview be calm as you will be interviewing many companies immediately, don\u2019t lose your patience.\n",
			"experience": "I was doing CSES and Codeforces questions as most of the first round questions will be purely logical and not standard algorithmic questions. It helps a lot to look after some standard design questions. The biggest challenge I faced was with Dynamic programming and math questions. I referred to a lot of questions but couldn\u2019t solve them at the moment. Just practice makes things perfect. So do practice a lot.",

Even if you have multiple projects or research experience, if you lack in DSA it becomes exponentially hard to land interviews. You need to be able to come up with solutions to unfamiliar problems and code it within the time constraints. Each problem will be different but most of them will follow some pattern or an overarching concept, hence you need to be able to identify the concept and relate them to questions done before. Timed practice really builds proficiency needed to crack these rounds. It is also very crucial to identify weak areas and practice on improving them. For me they were topics which used multiple concepts to solve, for example dp on trees, etc. Always try to solve problems one or two levels above your caliber. If you start getting bored, it is a good indicator to up the level of problems you are facing.Towards the end me and my friends used to filter questions on leetcode and do only the hard ones.This kept the challenge fresh in mind and improve the much needed code proficiency.\nIn the interviews it is important to think out loud as the interviewers are more interested in your thought process than your answers. Do not be hesitant to ask for hints and keep the interviewer involved in the solving process thereby making it a collaborative experience rather than a mundane viva session. Bluffing on resume is a bad idea as anything on it is a fair game and the interviewers will expect you to any question regarding the same. Make sure to revise all the projects listed there.\nHR rounds basically evaluate your soft and people skills as well as your response to uncertainties and challenges. A good resource for preparation is (https://www.indiabix.com/hr-interview/questions-and-answers/). A general pattern to answer HR questions is to display your optimistic attitude in dealing with problems with a calm demeanor. Your confidence will be challenged many times during the interview process. The interviewers will deliberately try to put you under pressure and challenge your solution at times. Don't get agitated or nervous and answer with confidence and humility.",
			"tips": "The placement process is a numbers game so you need to clear the written round of as many companies as possible to be placed in a good place. Always be clear while communicating with the interviewer and answer calmly and confidently. Also make sure you keep in touch with the company coordinator so that your interviews dont clash with each other. In the end it helps to keep in mind the role luck plays in the placement process so don't worry much if you botch an interview or two.",
			"experience": "As for material, the standard interview preparation sites are enough. Some good ones are leetcode, interview bit and codeforces. I started my preparation around mid August and was able to complete the programming track of interview bit and move to leetcode. ",

			"experience": "Right now you are reading my experience i had also same time when i was reading others experience and was very nervous that kaise hoga apna .  I started proper coding in May .Starting coding so much late was a biggest mistake. The thing is when i came to collge i was  very chill like everything is done no need to study further and seniors also used to say that cgpa does not matter but that is not true guys . I had courses c , data structure and algo in my 1st and 2nd year but i didn't studied it nicely because i was not knowing the importance of these courses and nobody told me that for placement u need to learn these courses and have to do competitive coding .I would say that placement is quiet easy if u know things earlier and start earlier but we actually start very late so sometimes it is hectic at last . I didn't get intern  because at that time i had not done any coding even in my friends circle no body was so much prepared and only some  people get intern . Actually people who get intern are smart they know things long ago and they will not tell you in normal conversation(joke) . Finally i started my placement prep after not getting intern and may be many of u will be on same pitch no worry apka bhai tumhara  placement karwayega. See almost everyone will get  placement but the thing which matters is CTC .Either you r in 1st year , 2nd year or in 3rd year start following the things which i m going to share next . I had not a good project or intern so i started working on to make a nice project for placement and this was my one of gold decision which finally landed me to get  24lpa in Saas Labs Us Inc . I saw many people saying project doesn't matter but that's totally not right . If you have relevant project then u have an edge or  u should have very good competitive coding skill to crack company . Intern matters but it's not like if u dont get intern then u will not get job but yeah if u did inten then u have an edge over others. For my project i chose full stack developement area inspired by my one of IITG friend and IITH friend Sarath . I will recommend u to make project on full stack because there is a lot of demand and a lot of company is vising for this. I would say full stack project is so powerful if u have good project on it and good knowledge then company can offer u without much trouble.  I learned full stack from codewithharry channel( an amazing and best content by IITD guy  link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mbwJ2xhgzM&list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg ) and did the same project .\nI designed my project in hurry in 2 month of 7th sem Jan and Feb. For c++ and Data structure u can see saurav sukla lecture (https://youtu.be/5uTQz43k4gg). i will recommend nptel lec for algorithm concept (https://youtu.be/gY0MwGLq9W8). And for competitive programming you must must watch Aditya verma all  video  (https://youtu.be/ntCGbPMeqgg) and i also and almost everyone watch it. As there are lot of coding qn so i would suggest u to solve  450 famous  love babbar sheet  coding qn (https://youtu.be/4iFALQ1ACdA) and i too did. You sometimes find difficulty in solving by ur own so never hesitate to take help ,at the end  u should know the things . As in coding test qns are not in straight and it will be  in story form and there will be time limitations so for that you try to solve some top qn (100-200 as much )  from leetcode with timer. There are lot of platform for practice i tried  almost each but  leetcode is best .Also do some qn from hackerearth because in this u have to write code from scratch but mostly u have to write function for that leetcode is good .  Don't waste time deciding platform you sometimes find the same qn and many asked qn will be seen they rarely invent qn .database and Sql is very important i was asked a lot .I used (https://www.w3schools.com/)  and  (https://youtu.be/kBdlM6hNDAE) for sql and dbms.If u do all these things u are well prepared .If ur placement is near try to revise more rather than exploring new things.  Some cs subject knowledge like oops , CN etc  is required so also read them well they are easy .You can try interviewbit if u have time .There are lot of things to do so it is necessary to start earlier .As we need motivation to do so much things so what i did was i formed a group of my 5 friends and listed 450 qn in sheet .All people have access to sheet and all people write the no of qn they are solving per day and that was the motivation . Everyone trying to solve as much as possible . So guys keep healty competition ,share knowledge with friends that will help together to grow. These are only things/mantra u need to do to grab a descent ctc. I got to know this very late but i suggest u to stick to it from now and prepare  100% and bade payar se tum fodoge. People  who do  not prepare only scare otherwise it is quite easy believe me .It is far easy than JEE advance, i realised later .\nYou can connect me on insta or fb for any query \nhttps://www.instagram.com/_vinod_iith_choupal_2960/ \nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100075288895150",

They do not care below \n        topics)\n2.\tOperating Systems, DBMS & OOPS\n3.\tC/C++, Python, SQL programming experience\n4.\tProbability, Statistics Preparation Methodology:\n        a.\tSpend a lot of time in deciding which data structure(s) you are going to use in \n               solving the problems that you solve throughout your preparation. \n        b.\tHave a mapping in your mind of all algorithms and data structures, their \n               advantages, disadvantages, complexities etc. and connect them with the problem \n               that you are solving, which helps you optimize your approach. \n        c.\tAvoid watching YouTube videos (like dummies), instead read references/articles \n               and think (a lot) until you understand the algorithm. \n        d.\tDo not jump into the code editor before using your pen, paper, mind. \n        e.\tIn the beginning, it may take a lot of time to understand things, but it gets better. Do \n               not worry about wasting time. The only wastage of time is worrying about time \n               wastage.\n        f.\tFinally, the language. Use whatever language you prefer for competitive \n               programming but, if you do not know C/C++ it may cost you a job. (Happened to \n               one of my friends). So, do not be proud of yourself if you can draw fancy curves in \n               python (every idiot can do it) and start understanding/using C++ (earlier the better). \n               You are gonna love it.",
			"tips": "Online Round:-\na.\tMath / Aptitude \u2013 no preparation, tips required. Just go with the flow.\nb.\tCoding Tests \u2013 Most of them are standard questions decorated with bullshit. Be \n        thorough with standard algorithms (dijkshtra, knapsack, kadane\u2019s, etc.) and take \n        time to think and figure out which data structure/algorithm can be used to solve the \n        problem. \nc.\tMake yourself extremely fluent with C++ containers and their functions. \nd.\tFirst read all the coding questions. Start solving the easiest first. Move to next problem \n        only if you successfully pass all (or most) of the test cases in current problem. \ne.\tDBMS, OS, OOPS, Python, C++/C are also asked. Read and understand the concepts.\n \nTechnical Rounds:-\na.\tMany (not all) of the technical interviews are basically online coding round except your \n        screen is shared and the interviewer interacts with you constantly. Be prepared for this. \nb.\tA fancy resume with lots of projects, skills, experiences etc. is not at all required. Just \n        put whatever you have learnt, in your resume. Make sure that you will be able to answer \n        any questions asked based on points from your resume. \nc.\tIn technical rounds, lengthy algorithms like backtracking, dynamic programming, etc. \n        were asked. So, revise these topics before attending technical rounds. \n\nHR Rounds Be prepared with your answers for these types of questions:-\na.\tWhy IT? Why our company? \nb.\tExplain a tough situation in your life and how you did you overcome it? \nc.\tAny plans for masters? (say no, obviously) \nd.\tWhy is your CGPA low? \ne.\tWhat are your aspirations? What do you want in your professional life?",

The question difficulty level was medium to hard.\nRound 2:- Technical interview round\nThis round was based on DSA, OOPS. Interview went for around 1 hour. Total of 5 coding questions were asked, all were easy to medium level, topics including bit manipulation, dynamic programming, linked list and graph and to tell the correct time complexity with proper approach and after solving question they asked me to optimise and tell time complexity.\nLater i was asked oops concepts and some real life examples of it. Then he asked me about my internships and projects which I told them briefly.",
			"preparation": "Strong knowledge of DSA is must. If you are aware of algorithms and most of the data structures then it's easy to clear most of the rounds. I used gfg and leetcode for my practice. For interview, i asked my friends to take my mock interview and tell me my mistakes. For anyone who is preparing for placement, it's not hard to get an offer, be consistent and keep practicing.",
